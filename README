Readme for PHP form mailer

This is a simple little form mailer that you can plunk onto
your php server and call from an HTML form with action="formMailer.php" and method="post".

I wrote it for a client and saved it because I always need one and never have it.

Two important things. You want to have a hidden input field with a value of "youremail@email.com"
and a name of "Email". You also want to have an empty text input field called "noRobot"
that you set to a style of display: none. This is to replace the need for Captcha.

Use and modify away!

Happy coding!
